MUSIC APPLICATION 
By Music Team - Stacey, Dmitry, Devin, Harper

Project Scope & User Story
Our project is a Music Application, which can be used for music recognition through lyrics and sound. Also, the user can use other key words as well, such as the song’s name, the singer/band’s name, or a specific genre.

User Story:
As I am a music lover, I’d love to enter some lyrics and receive information about this song, and some more detailed information, such as the album and video clip.

Target Audience
Our target audience is for those music lovers who heard some great music clips on the train or when shopping in the shopping center or when they accidentally just could not recall a song or a singer’s full name. In this scenario, they are dying to know the name and the singer so that they could listen to the song and the singer’s other albums.

Tools, Timelines & Tasks

In this project, we will be HTML, CSS (Bootstrap & Bulma), JavaScript (jQuery), and Geolocation API plus another two new APIs.



The project timeline is roughly as follows:
During each step, there will be a full cycle of testing the functioning capabilities:
HTML basic drafts & CSS layout: Bootstrap and Bulma (https://bulma.io/documentation/)
JavaScript/jQuery coding for each button, input area and output area
In this stage, the project will be split into the following parts:
In the index page, 
for the SEARCH input: use JS/jQuery to deal with the functions, and then using API to get data;
for the FAVOURITES display: use JS/jQuery to get data from localStorage and display it in the specified div, the list can be deleted one by one or clear all by one button, the user can also play the music directly on the page by clicking on the PLAYING button
In the result page, 
for each result displaying card: utilising the data retrieved from the SEARCH input and display it into the specified div, together with details button leading to the DETAILS page, a favourite button to save the song to the favourites list, a PLAYING button which can play the song directly on the page, a YOUTUBE button which can lead to the external youtube page, and the MORE button which could display three more results
In the details page, 
for the DETAILS display, utilising the data retrieved from the SEARCH input and display more details such as the full-length lyrics, other tracks inside the albums, the released year, and other recommended singers/bands.
for the GO BACK button, the user could go back to the result page
Utilising APIs to retrieve data
Combine all the files to complete the project


The tasks of the project can be summarized as follows:
One is responsible for the whole HTML and CSS layout for every page, and the SEARCH and FAVOURITES display in the index page. Also responsible for assembling all the functions to form a viable music application product.
One is responsible for the RESULT displaying card on the RESULT page, utilising the data retrieved from API and display in the specified div, and the FAVOURITES button. The user should be able to add a song to the favourite list by clicking on the button. This should persist even if the user refreshes the page.
One is responsible for the PLAYING button, YOUTUBE button on the RESULT page, and the MORE button. PLAYING is for playing the music on current page, YOUTUBE is for external link to YouTube music videos, and the MORE is for displaying three more other results. When there is less than three results left, the MORE button should disappear, and shows NO MORE RESULTS or some similar message instead. PLAYING button can be used by index page and details page. 
One is responsible for the whole DETAILS page. Utilising the data from the SEARCH and displaying more detailed information, such as the Song’s name, singer/band’s name, albums with other tracks in the same album, the released year and displaying full-length lyrics. Also for the GO BACK button, which should allow the user to go back to the RESULT page.

Our application is not to be exactly like the websites above but some of the layouts can be somehow alike, such as:
